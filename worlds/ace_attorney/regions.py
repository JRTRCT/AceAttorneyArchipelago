# A region is a container for locations ("checks"), which connects to other regions via "Entrance" objects.
# Many games will model their Regions after physical in-game places, but you can also have more abstract regions.
# For a location to be in logic, its containing region must be reachable.
# The Entrances connecting regions can have rules - more on that in rules.py.
# This makes regions especially useful for traversal logic ("Can the player reach this part of the map?")

# Every location must be inside a region, and you must have at least one region.
# This is why we create regions first, and then later we create the locations (in locations.py).
